# osler_v4 — RUN STATE

> **This file is the loop's memory.** The live copy is `loops/osler_v4/STATE.md`
> (committed, so the operator can review it remotely). Read it at the start of every
> iteration, before the plan. If it disagrees with your recollection, **the file
> wins** — your context may have been compacted since the last iteration.
>
> **How to update:** set the task `IN_PROGRESS` with a UTC start time *before* working;
> on completion set `DONE` or `BLOCKED — <reason>`, fill the finished time, and append a
> ≤5-line entry to the iteration log. Never delete a log entry; append only. Timestamps
> are `date -u +%FT%TZ`. Never paste item text, predictions, or secrets into this file.

Loop status: `RUNNING`  <!-- set to STOPPED at the hard stop (Y11), or when no PENDING task can proceed without the operator -->
Run started (UTC): `<fill in bootstrap>`
Last updated (UTC): `<fill in every iteration>`
Iterations so far: `<increment each wake>`

## 1. Task board

Statuses: `PENDING` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `DONE` | `BLOCKED — reason`

| id | task | GPU | deps | status | started (UTC) | finished (UTC) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Y0 | Orientation, Nemotron serving, MIMIC guard | small | — | PENDING | | |
| Y1 | MIMIC foundation (tables, sections, splits) | no | Y0 | PENDING | | |
| Y2 | MIMIC structured-gold templates (+ Y2b late sources when present) | no | Y1 | PENDING | | |
| Y3 | Nemotron-crafted minimal pairs (`mimic_doc_support_v1`) | yes | Y0, Y1 | PENDING | | |
| Y4 | Fast dev v4, CG v2, MIMIC audit suite v1, baselines | yes | Y2, Y3 | PENDING | | |
| Y5 | pplx 27B soft labels (only if D48 confirmed) | yes | Y0 | PENDING | | |
| Y6 | Stage A: A4, A5 + re-scored A0/A1/A3 + choice | yes | Y4, Y5 | PENDING | | |
| Y7 | Stage B: blocks B1–B4 under keep rule v2 | yes | Y6 | PENDING | | |
| Y8 | Final Osler-4B (63,304 steps) | yes | Y7 | PENDING | | |
| Y9 | Evaluation, Gate O4, size-class scoreboard | yes | Y8 | PENDING | | |
| Y10 | Memorisation and PHI audit | small | Y8 | PENDING | | |
| Y11 | Findings and closure — HARD STOP | no | all | PENDING | | |

Rules: take the **first** `PENDING` task whose deps are all `DONE` (order exceptions and the GPU sequence in ADVISORY §5).
Never run two GPU jobs at once (the Nemotron server counts). A `BLOCKED` task does not block unrelated work. No row may be
left `IN_PROGRESS` at closure.

## 2. Key values discovered during the run

**Operator confirmations** (filled by the operator before kickoff; the loop never edits these two lines):
- D48 (pplx 27B soft-label distillation on general items): `<yes | no>`
- D46, D47, D49, D50 (MIMIC design, keep rule v2, Gate O4, final length): `<yes | no>`

| key | value | source | task |
|---|---|---|---|
| suite counts (passed / skipped / deselected) | | | Y0 |
| Nemotron serving: flags that worked, out tok/s, requests/h, peak memory | | | Y0 |
| MIMIC: patients / admissions / notes per split; ICD-10 share; token p50/p95 | | `loops/osler_v4/mimic.md` | Y1 |
| MIMIC templates: train/dev/test items, NB screen, majority rate per template | | `loops/osler_v4/mimic.md` | Y2 |
| minimal pairs: pilot keep rate per mode, chosen mode, cue AUC, pairs built | | `loops/osler_v4/crafted.md` | Y3 |
| fast dev v4 partitions; CG v2 size and sources; MIMIC suite v1 templates and items | | | Y4 |
| pplx 27B: revision, licence, parity, anchor items scored, overlap check (must be 0) | | | Y5 |
| Stage A: MR, knowledge, CG v2 per run; the chosen recipe | | `loops/osler_v4/stage_a.md` | Y6 |
| Stage B: kept blocks; own / MR / general / knowledge / CG v2 per block; MIMIC share | | `loops/osler_v4/blocks.md` | Y7 |
| final: steps, selected step, CG v2 and MIMIC trend | | | Y8 |
| Gate O4 verdict (4B) | | `loops/osler_v4/gate_o4.md` | Y9 |
| audit: membership AUC; verbatim matches (model vs base) | | `loops/osler_v4/audit.md` | Y10 |

## 3. Current task checklist

**Fill this in before starting any task**, by copying that task's concrete steps out of
the plan as unticked boxes. Tick each one the moment it is finished, not at the end.
This is the only record of progress *within* a task — without it, a compaction mid-task
leaves you unable to tell what you already did.

Clear this section and write the new task's checklist when you start the next task; the
completed checklist goes into the iteration-log entry.

```
Task in flight: none
Working dir:    outputs/osler_v4/<id>/

- [ ] <step 1>
- [ ] <step 2>
- [ ] acceptance check run and passed
- [ ] self-audit (R6) written to SELF_AUDIT.md
- [ ] CLAIMS.md rows appended
- [ ] STATE updated, committed, pushed
```

## 4. Iteration log (append only, newest last)

<!-- Template for each entry:
### <task-id> — <DONE|BLOCKED> — <UTC timestamp>
- What ran: <command or script>
- Output: <path>
- Headline: <one number or one sentence, with its CLAIMS id>
- Surprises: <anything unexpected, or "none">
- Next: <what this unblocks>
-->

<!-- The Headline line matters beyond this file: these headlines are the raw material
     FINDINGS.md's Summary section is written from at closure. A headline that only
     makes sense with full context ("done, see report") starves the summary. Write
     each one so a reader who has not seen the task can repeat it: what was measured,
     what came out, with what denominator. -->

## 5. Blocked items

| id | what is blocked | exact reason | what would unblock it |
|---|---|---|---|

---

## 6. Questions for the operator

Anything you could not resolve without a human. Be specific enough to answer without
re-reading the run: state the ambiguity, the options, and which you would pick.

---

## 7. Deviations from the plan

Any place you departed from GOAL/ADVISORY, with the reason. An empty section is the
expected outcome. Editing code or a check to make it pass is never an acceptable
deviation — that is a `BLOCKED`.

---

## 8. Closure summary feed

<!-- Filled at closure, feeding FINDINGS.md's Summary section. One row per major
     outcome, in the order a human should hear them. Each claim cites its CLAIMS id;
     failures and blocked tasks get rows too. -->

| # | outcome (one sentence, plain language) | claims | artifact |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |
